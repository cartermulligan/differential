pretty much same stuff in the about, but essentially just a freehand model based around an image
of a differential. All numbers and scaling was from me so not going to be 100% accurate, 
especially the gear ratios, but the whole thing is mostly parametric so changing the gear teeth
count should as well change the gear teeth depth, width, etc.
